Hey Mark, 

If you like the project and want to deploy it you'll have to deploy two things 1. The flask application that serves the api endpoint and 2. The react web-app that allows an easy endpoint to the api. 

You will also have to create a .env file for the flask application (see the example.env file for the correct structure) with your open-ai key that will allow you to use the open-ai api. Please see the [openai docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication). 

Any questions feel free to reach out.
